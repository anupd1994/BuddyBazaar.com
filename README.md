A Trust based recommendation engine.
## Introduction
Most commercial recommender systems are strongly supported by the demographic information of users. Since some of the similarities within a network are caused by the influence and interactions of its members, it would be reasonable and feasible to develop a social recommendation based on the connections of individual users. In reality, people tend to be affected by the opinions of and suggestions by people with similar interests, shopping experts, and close friends. However, most of current social networking platform, such as Facebook and twitter, and electronic commerce platform, such as Amazon and Yahoo! Shopping, are independently operated. The supporting recommender systems are also independently deployed on the two kinds of platforms based on social factors and purchase history respectively. As a result, the electronic commerce (retailing) platforms generally do not consider social factors such as relationships and trust etc. among the users and the power of social influence is not exploited. Contrarily, social networking platforms generally do not consider online shopping related factors such as purchase history and product rating etc.So we've integrated a social network (in our case Facebook) and an online shopping site, wherein the user could ask for recommendations from his friends.
